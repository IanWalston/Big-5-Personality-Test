# BIG5

This is a personality test based on L.R. Goldberg's Big-Five factor markers. The test questions come from the [International Personality Item Pool.](https://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm)

You can take the full 50 questions for an acurate score, or you can take a shorter set of 10 or more questions. 

The test then shows you a celebrity that has a similar score.
